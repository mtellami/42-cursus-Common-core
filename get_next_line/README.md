# 42cursus: get next line
### 🔥Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious🔥
</div>

> This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor. This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.

---
### ♦️ Main Topic
**File descriptor.**
- What is file descriptor ?

A file descriptor is a number that uniquely identifies an open file in a computer's operating system. It describes a data resource, and how that resource may be accessed.

- Read function ?

The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf.
